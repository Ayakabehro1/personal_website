I am a Masters student at the University of Waterloo studying economics. Prior to my Masters education, I spent several years in the field working as a Research Associate in academia and as a Economic Advisor for the Ontario Public Service. Having experience in my field, I have gained experience in applying my undergraduate economics education to practice and have narrowed my career aspirations. My goal is to finish my Masters degree in June 2023 and enter the field of economic consulting or economic policy research.

This website encompasses my resume (available in both PDF and HTML format), my interests which are illustrated in my Journal, and my publications. In my free time, I hope to contribute more to my Journal and finalize projects which are currently in the works. Please feel free to reach out to me via email, twitter or linkedin.
