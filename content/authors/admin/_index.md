Hello and welcome to my website!

I am a Masters of Economics student at the University of Waterloo, with a particular interest in economic research and data analysis. Prior to my Masters education, I worked in the field for several years as a Research Associate in academia and as a Economic Advisor for the Ontario Public Service. This experience, in culmination with my Masters education, have inspired me to work in applied economic research and/or economic policy analysis.

This website delves into my resume (available in both PDF and HTML format), my interests which are illustrated in my Journal, and my publications. In my free time, I hope to contribute more to my Journal and finalize projects which are currently in the works. Please feel free to reach out to me via email, twitter or Linkedin.
