<h2>Finally creating my own site!</h2>
<p>After almost a year of deciding to create a personal website, it has finally come to fruition! After many months of playing around with various website generator platforms (notably Wordpress and Squarespace), I decided to do a 180 and use <code>R Blogdown</code>.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money</strong>: most website generator platforms cost between <a href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-websites/how-much-should-a-website-cost/" target="_blank">$6-50 per month</a> (for a basic subscription). As a (sort of) student, I want to cut costs where I can.</li>
<li><strong>Skill</strong>: While I am currently learning how to code HTML (slowly), I am nowhere near the skill necessary to code an entire personal website. That said, while I’m no HTML wiz, I do consider myself quite the R wizard. With a bit of research, a lot of patience and some learning I was able to put together this website. <small> (with many thanks to the various R forums and tutorials on the internet) </small></li>
<li><strong>Practicality</strong>: For the foreseeable future, I plan to be in the field of economic research or applied economics. After seeing many of my mentors and fellow economists develop similar websites, I wanted a platform suitable for research and academia Low and behold, the <a href="https://wowchemy.com/" target="_blank">Hugo Academic</a> theme! I found many website platforms catered to website platforms for companies and online shops, which is unfortunately unideal for my circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I continue developing my programming skills and contribute more to my website, I hope to refine certain elements and customize my site further. Which leads me to my next topic, <em>what is this site for</em>?</p>

<h2>Using this website to share my research, projects, and day-to-day life.</h2>
<p>As a young economist and professional, I want a platform where I can share my research and interests with fellow economists and friends. That said, I am currently at a point in my career where I am exploring fields, economic areas and interests. Having completed my degree from UofT this year, I now have no such setting to “take courses” and learn new material. Therefore, I am taking it into my own hands and using this platform to share new research I develop and, admittedly, hold myself accountable.</p>
