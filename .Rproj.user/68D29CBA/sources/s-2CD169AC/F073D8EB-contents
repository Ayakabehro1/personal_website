**Economic Papers:**  
  - [Bulls and Bears Surfing the Web: Investigating the Effect of Reddit Sentiment on Stock Performance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SOp_1ZeqNNRR4zo8H3UnApr1_DLrObaV/view?usp=sharing)   
      - **Course**: ECO475 - Applied Econometrics II (Professor Yuanyuan Wan, Winter 2021)
      - **Summary**: This paper is co-written with Gabrielle Carelli Yamamoto and Sumit Somani and investigates the relationship between Reddit sentiment and stock returns using a generated daily Reddit sentiment index and daily stock returns for a synthetic Dow Jones Industrial Index from 2016-2019. Using an vector autoregressive model (VAR), Granger causality, an impulse response function and an event study, we find evidence supportive of the existence of a relationship between Reddit sentiment and stock performance.
  - [Investigating the Relationship between Board Structure and CEO Compensation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/195JzB2fveMj8v_ULMNINdbkk5RtGpCq6/view?usp=sharing)   
      - **Course**: ECO464 - Empirical Financial Economics (Professor Peter Cziraki, Fall 2020)   
      - **Summary**: This paper poses the question: *does board structure affect CEO compensation?* Under the framework of the agency theory and managerial power theory, the paper hypothesizes that there is a relationship between board structure and CEO compensation such that mechanisms that enable boards to operate at an arms-length will reduce CEO compensation. The paper uses a differences-and-differences methodology to test the hypothesis, finding insignificant results. Due to the inconclusiveness in the academic literature, the paper argues that the nature of the relationship between board structure and CEO compensation is not concretely understood.   

**Policy Papers**:
  - [Tent Cities: A Negative Externality Calling Public and Government Attention to the Growing Homelessness Problem in Victoria, BC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaoPldrIn3NSqx0QDxhwgL-8EQMDwNnV/view?usp=sharing)

The paper summarizes the evolution of homelessness and 'tent city' from 2008-2020, current policies and proposes short- and long-term policy solutions at the municipal and provincial level.
